                <li>
                    **Prepare the Chicken:** In a bowl, toss the cubed chicken with 1 tbsp Soy Sauce, Oyster Sauce, and a pinch of white pepper. Set aside for 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Cook the Chicken:** Heat 1 tbsp of oil in the wok over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry until fully cooked and lightly browned. Remove the chicken from the wok and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Scramble the Eggs:** Add a little more oil to the wok. Pour in the beaten eggs and quickly scramble them until set. Push the eggs to one side of the wok.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the remaining oil to the empty side of the wok. Add the minced garlic and diced onion, and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Add the Rice:** Add the day-old rice to the wok. Use a spatula to break up any clumps. Stir-fry rapidly for 2-3 minutes to heat the rice and lightly toast the grains.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Incorporate Vegetables:** Add the frozen peas and carrots mix. Continue stir-frying until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Combine and Season:** Return the cooked chicken and scrambled eggs to the wok. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of Soy Sauce and the Sesame Oil. Stir everything together quickly to evenly coat the ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Final Adjustment:** Taste the rice and add salt and white pepper as needed. Serve immediately while hot!
